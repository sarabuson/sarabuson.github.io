				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>What are the physical processes at work in AGN and the
					particle content of their jets? What fraction of cosmic rays
					may be ultimately linked to AGN? These are the compelling
					questions of the astroparticle multimessenger field that have
					always fascinated me and on which I have focused my efforts
					as a scientist. On the one hand blazars, our Universe’ "monsters",
					on the other hand the unpredictable, transient and variable
					high-energy domain.
				  </p><p>
					To pursue my research, I take advantage of observations throughout
					the whole electromagnetic spectrum thanks to a close collaboration
					with international multi-wavelength groups.
					As new means became available
					e.g., astrophysical neutrinos and gravitational waves, I have learned how to
					exploit them, using the synergy of electromagnetic data
					and multimessenger observations in combination with the time-domain
					information to pinpoint out Universe's cosmic ray accelerators.</p>
				<p>This investigative approach has demonstrated to be a
				promising path. In these years I had the privilege of
				playing a major role in breakthrough results in vibrant
				areas of astrophysics, i.e. neutrinos and gravitational waves.
				I have led projects that significantly helped providing clues
				on the extraterrestrial neutrino origin, and the analysis tools
				that I developed are being used for the quest of
				electromagnetic counterparts of cosmic neutrinos.</p>
				<h2>Research Interests</h2>
				<p>My group interest spans a broad range of astrophysical topics, at a glance:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>Cosmic Particle Accelerators</h3>
					<p>Cosmic rays are charged subatomic particles that hit Earth from deep in outer space.
						They can be extraordinarily powerful, and reach energies up to 100 million times
						greater than any attained by human-made particle collider.
						The same sources from which these highly energetic cosmic rays
						originate are thought to produce other types of particles: neutrinos
						and gamma-rays. Neutrinos and gamma-rays are neutral and can travel
						unimpeded throughout space. As a matter of fact, while cosmic rays are
						deflected, these two messengers point straight back to their origin
						and can be used to trace the intergalactic pace back, revealing their emitter.
            Our group explots the synergy of Fermi-LAT γ-ray data and neutrino observations to pinpoint
            the sources of cosmic rays, and gain insights about the physical mechanisms acting in those sources.
          </p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>Origin of Cosmic Neutrinos</h3>
					<p>Neutrinos are nearly massless, ghostly particles that rarely interact with matter.
						As such, they are very challenging to detect and only few times they get
						captured in the world’s largest neutrino detector, i.e. the IceCube Observatory.
						IceCube consists of an array of thousands of sensors buried in the Antarctic ice,
						encompassing a cubic kilometer volume at the South Pole.
						The detection by IceCube of an astrophysical neutrino flux in the 10 TeV to 10 PeV energy range
						opened a new window to the high-energy Universe.
						Despite the notable step forward the origin of these neutrinos remains a mystery.
						No neutrino point-source has been confidently detected so far and the isotropic sky
						distribution of IceCube neutrinos points to a dominant extragalactic origin.
						<br>
						Since it became operational in 2010, IceCube has captured only few hundreds
						of likely-astrophysical neutrinos (i.e. high-energy neutrinos, with energies >TeV).
						None of those has
						been capable of providing incontrovertible evidence about their astrophysical origin.
						Nevertheless, an encouraging step forward was made in 2017 with the
						identification of a flaring gamma-ray blazar as the first, most promising
						extragalactic neutrino point-source. Read more in NASA's press release:

				</p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Gamma-ray astronomy with <i>Fermi</i>-LAT</h3>
				<p>Gamma rays are the most energetic form of light and can be studied
					with the  Large Area Telescope (LAT), onboard <thead>
					<i>Fermi</i>	Gamma-ray Space Telescope </thead> space observatory.
					The <i>Fermi</i> satellite was launched by NASA in 2008 and is in a low Earth orbit.
					The LAT has the capability to monitor gamma rays from the entire sky in just three hours.
					Its capability to continuously observe the whole high-energy (MeV-GeV) sky
					has enabled us with unprecedented sensitivity to search for variable
					and transient behavior from both previously known and unknown gamma-ray sources.
					The <i>Fermi</i> catalogues host several thousands of objects,
					the overwhelming majority of which belong to a special type of Active Galaxies,
					dubbed <strong>blazars</strong>.
					Blazars are among the brightest electromagnetic obhects hosted in our Universe,
					and the most powerful, persistent sources.
					They release the majority of their energy in the gamma-ray energy band and
					their electromagnetic emission can be variable on different timescale:
					it can persist over years, or last fractions of seconds.
